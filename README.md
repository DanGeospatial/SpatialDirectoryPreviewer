# SpatialDirectoryPreviewer
A simple tool for quickly listing geospatial files, previewing the file and displaying metadata.

Important! This version does not have all features fully implemented. It will list files but not preview them.
This project makes up the basis for Drone-Image-Selector which focuses on selecting groups of drone images.

Dependencies:
- Java 17
- JavaFX 17.0.1
- GeoTools 28-SNAPSHOT
- Maven 4.0

Usage:
- Currently supports .shp and .tiff files
- After a folder is selected then the window will automatically populate
- Toggling the preview window will bring up a seperate window for currently selected file


TODO:
- Expand this README
- Fix filter tool to sort by date and file extension
- Finish metadata lookup
- Implement file previewer
